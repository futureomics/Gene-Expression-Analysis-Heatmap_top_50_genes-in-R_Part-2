# Gene Expression Analysis with Heatmap of Top 50 Genes

This repository contains an R script/workflow for performing gene expression analysis and visualizing the top 50 differentially expressed genes using a heatmap. The analysis is suitable for RNA-seq or microarray datasets and uses standard Bioconductor packages.

## Features

- Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 or limma
- Heatmap generation of the top 50 most variable or significant genes
- Customizable plots with annotations
- Exportable results (CSV, PDF/PNG)
